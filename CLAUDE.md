# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**rsbl** is a real-time rendering framework. This is a new project with minimal code currently in place.

## Repository Status

This repository is in its initial stages. As of now, it contains only:
- README.md with basic project description
- LICENSE (MIT)
- No build system or source code yet

## Getting Started

Since this is a new project, the following will need to be established:
- Programming language(s) and tech stack
- Build system configuration
- Project structure and organization
- Core rendering architecture

When adding code, consider establishing:
- A clear directory structure for the rendering framework components
- Build configuration (e.g., Cargo.toml for Rust, CMakeLists.txt for C++, package.json for TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Testing framework setup
- Documentation for the rendering pipeline architecture
