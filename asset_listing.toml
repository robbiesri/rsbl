# Asset Listing Configuration
# This file defines external assets to be downloaded for development and testing
# Run scripts/download_assets.py to download all assets to sample_assets/

# Each asset entry should have:
#   name = "descriptive-name"
#   url = "URL to the asset or directory"
#   type = "glb" (single file) or "gltf" (directory with textures)
#   category = "optional category for organizing assets"
